Chatsnap
========

Chatsnap is an application that creates emoji from ngram elements (currently words) and uses them for chat purposes.
There is an old version of it somewhere that [arjunyg](https://github.com/arjunyg), [talbenari1](https://github.com/talbenari1), and I made for a hackathon in NodeJS (which I can't look at without vomiting). Some of that has been ported over to this version.

Our original goal with chatsnap was to recapture some of the magic of the 00's web that I feel has disappeared in recent years. 
50% imageboard, 50% irc, 100% weird webpage that would have shown up on slashdot.
I think we succeeded in making it "feel" like that era.

go-chatsnap runs pretty well on heroku. You need Yahoo BOSS api keys, Pubnub API keys, and a Redis addon. I'll probably try to set up one of those "deploy to heroku" buttons soon.
