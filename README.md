Chatsnap (Go edition)
=====================

I'm rewriting chatsnap in go. Chatsnap is an application that creates emoji from ngrams (usually words) and uses them for chat purposes.
There is an old NodeJS version of it somewhere I can't look at without vomiting that (arjunyg)[github.com/arjunyg], (talbenari1)[github.com/talbenari1], and I made for a hackathon. 
This should be a quick weekend project, I hope. (famous last words).

Feel free to fork or pull request, though I will be mostly following the existing design until I get an MVP running.

Our original goal with chatsnap was to recapture some of the magic of the 00's web that I feel has disappeared in recent years. 
Part imageboard, part irc, all weird webpage that would have shown up on slashdot.
I think we succeeded in making it "feel" like it's from that era.
